# Challenge Factorization Revenge (50pts)

We know the product of p and q, the difference of p and q.

n = p * q

dd = q - p => q = dd + p

n = p * (dd + p)

By solving the equation we can get p and q.    This is the [script](solve.py).

Decrypt the cipher, we get the flag HCMUS-CTF{haaaaah_what_do_you_really_want_from_meeeeeee}
