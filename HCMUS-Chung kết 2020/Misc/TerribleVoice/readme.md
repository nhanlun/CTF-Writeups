We watch the clip and get the chords are Am F C G Am7 C Cadd9 G7. The given folder contains 8 chords so we think that we have to replace the duplicated chord in our answer to the unused chord.  
Therefore, the pass to unzip the flag is AmFCGAm7Fmaj7Cadd9G7.

The flag is HCMUS-CTF{OK,So_you_heard_my_voice_ExcuseMe_T.T}
