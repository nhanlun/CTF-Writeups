# BruceLee

When we make a query to the server, it returns a binary string with length = 41. After some trial, we find out that if we put the correct character to the corect position, the bit at that position becomes 1.  
So, we bruteforce the server to get the flag. The code is included in file brucelee.py

The flag is HCMUS-CTF{bRuc3f<>rcInG_1z_g0oD_S0m3t$mE}
